# MLOps
Automation of machine Learning by using the tools of DevOps i.e Jenkins and Docker . This is a pure Jenkins+Docker+Github integration with the Machine Learning to automate the task of changing the parameters in the code and training the model until the required accuracy is not achieved through the model. When the Data Scientist (Developer) pushes the code here , Jenkins automatically pull the code and then checks it for being a Neural Network code or not . If yes , the main program code for training the model is run over a Docker container which has all the required resouces like python3 , keras , tensorflow installed in it . This docker container is launched in only 1 sec and accuracy is then evaluated for being the required one or not. If not , the tweaking of the main program is done and then again the main program is run for training the model . The best accuracy model is saved and then all the files are merged to the master branch of this repository.
